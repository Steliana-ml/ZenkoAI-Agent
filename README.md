# ZenkoAI-Agent

## ü§ñ Project Description

ZenkoAI-Agent is a conversational AI agent designed to act as a friendly customer support assistant for the "F√™te des Vendanges" (FDV) festival in Neuch√¢tel. This intelligent agent is built using Python, the LangChain library, and OpenAI's powerful language models to provide timely and accurate information to festival-goers.

The agent is specialized in answering a wide range of questions related to the festival, categorized into three main areas:

* **FAQ:** For general inquiries about the festival, including its history, event schedules, performers, transportation, and emergency information.
* **Cuisine:** To help users discover the variety of food and beverages available from different vendors at the festival.
* **Location:** To assist users in finding the specific locations of various stalls and attractions within the festival grounds.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

The ZenkoAI-Agent leverages a modular architecture that ensures efficient and accurate information retrieval. Here's a high-level overview of how it works:

![ZenkoAI-Agent Architecture](architecture.png)

1.  **User Interaction:** The user interacts with the **Conversation Agent**, which serves as the primary interface.
2.  **Intent Recognition:** The agent analyzes the user's query to determine the intent and directs the question to the most appropriate specialized retriever.
3.  **Information Retrieval:** Each retriever‚Äî**FAQ, Cuisine, and Location**‚Äîis responsible for a specific domain of knowledge. They are connected to a **Vector Store**, which contains indexed information from various data sources, including PDFs, GeoJSON, and CSV files.
4.  **Response Generation:** The retriever fetches the relevant information from the Vector Store, which is then used by the LLM to generate a coherent and user-friendly response.

This architecture allows the agent to handle a diverse range of queries with high accuracy and provide a seamless user experience.

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup and Installation

Follow these steps to set up and run the ZenkoAI-Agent on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

* **Python 3.7 or higher**
* **Linux or macOS environment** (due to the `jq` package dependency)

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/ZenkoAI-Agent.git](https://github.com/your-username/ZenkoAI-Agent.git)
    cd ZenkoAI-Agent
    ```

2.  **Install the required packages:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirement.txt
    ```

3.  **Set up your OpenAI API Key:**
    You'll need an OpenAI API key to use the language model. Set it as an environment variable in your system:
    ```bash
    export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-openai-api-key"
    ```

## üöÄ Usage

To start the agent and begin interacting with it, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
python agent.py
```

Once the agent is running, it will greet you, and you can start asking questions about the F√™te des Vendanges. The agent is designed to be a chatbot, so you can easily integrate it with your front-end interface by replacing the existing loop in `agent.py`.

### Prompt Engineering

For those looking to customize or enhance the agent's performance, you can modify the prompts for the **Cuisine** and **Location** retrievers. Fine-tuning these prompts can lead to more detailed and optimized results for specific types of queries.

Enjoy your experience with the ZenkoAI-Agent! üéâ
